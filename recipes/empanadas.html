    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Argentine empanadas typically have a semicircular shape, not exceeding 20 cm in diameter, and are closed by a crimped edge called "repulgue," which often comes in various shapes that help identify the filling flavor. The filling (also known as "recado" or "carbonada") varies from province to province, although the most common ones are beef, chicken, humita (corn filling with white sauce), ham and cheese, and vegetable fillings (usually Swiss chard or spinach) with cheese or white sauce. Beef empanadas usually contain onion, chopped hard-boiled eggs, olives, and, in some provinces, raisins, potatoes, or peas. They are seasoned with cumin, sweet paprika, and ground chili, and to make them juicier, they are often enriched with beef suet.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients to a clasical beef empanada</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 <a>empanada dough discs (tapas)</a> (If you wanna know how to make the <em>tapas</em> yourself click the link provided)</li>
        <li>1/2 kg of minced meat</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
        <li>A handful of olives</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot with hot oil, add the onion and bell pepper. Let them brown for a few minutes, and when they are halfway cooked (onion translucent), add the garlic and a little salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat and add all the minced meat at once. Stir the meat to prevent it from sticking. Once the meat is browned, add the diced tomato and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. Season with paprika and cumin, a bit more salt and pepper, and mix well. Cover (not completely, leave a small gap) and let it cook for about half an hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it cool in the pot. Add the chopped olives and mix well. (At this step, you can add any other ingredients you want: hard-boiled egg, raisins, potatoes, etc.)</li>
        <li>Distribute the filling onto the empanada dough discs, and close them with a traditional crimped edge. Before placing them in the oven, you can optionally brush them with beaten egg (as an argentinian myself highly recommend!).</li>
        <li>Place our meat empanadas on a baking sheet and bake in a hot oven until golden brown, and enjoy!</li>
