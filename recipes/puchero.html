    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Argentine Puchero is a traditional dish dating back to the pre-independence era. Like many one-pot dishes, it allows cooking various ingredients in a single pot at the same time. Therefore, the preparation is simple, as the ingredients are placed in stages of cooking in a pot with water. Once cooked, the solid ingredients are separated from the broth. The solid ingredients are served on the plate and are seasoned to taste with olive oil and spices such as salt, pepper, parsley, and, less commonly, mustard. It is typically enjoyed during the winter, and due to its abundance of ingredients, it is very nutritious and satisfying.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kilogram of ossobuco (beef shank or roast beef)</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
        <li>2 medium sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 squash</li>
        <li>400 grams of pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 ears of corn</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 spring onion</li>
        <li>1 leek</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>A handful of parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, fill a large pot with 3/4 of water. Place it on the heat, and when it starts boiling, add the meat cut into large pieces. Cook for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Without removing the pot from the heat, add the parsley, leek, and spring onion. You can tie these vegetables with cooking twine to make them easier to remove later. Then, add the peeled carrot and the ears of corn cut into large pieces. Finally, place the onion cut in half. Cover the pot and let it boil for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the peeled and cut potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, and pumpkin into large pieces. Season the preparation with salt and pepper, then cover the pot again. Cook the stew until the potatoes and sweet potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>To serve the stew, remove the bundle of parsley, leek, and spring onion. Place the meat and vegetables on the plates without the broth.</li>
        <li>Finally, on the plate, drizzle with olive oil and a little more salt and pepper. Eat it hot, ideally on cold winter nights.</li>
