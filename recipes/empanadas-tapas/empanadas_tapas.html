    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What's better than some delicious homemade empanada dough? The dough is really easy to make and turns out great. <br>
    With the recipe I'm giving you, you'll get a dozen and a half of good-sized dough discs, perfect for stuffing them nice and plump. <br>
    This empanada dough can be used for baking or frying.</p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of fine salt</li>
        <li>50 grams of butter or lard (pork or beef)</li>
        <li>250 cc. water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pot or saucepan, heat the water with the butter or lard. Once dissolved, turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, place the 500 grams of flour with the salt, make a well in the center, add the semi-beaten egg and the lukewarm water with butter or lard.</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients well, transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until you achieve a smooth and tender dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for half an hour.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, flour the surface and roll it out to the desired thickness, typically 2 to 3 mm thick.</li>
        <li>Cut out discs using a 10 cm diameter pastry cutter. Fill them to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
